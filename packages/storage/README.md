# Shieldbow cache

A shieldbow implementation for caching.

This package is not meant to be used by itself, instead use the `shieldbow` package.

---

If for some reason you want to use just the cache, it can be installed by itself using:

```bash
$ npm install @shieldbow/cache

$ yarn add @shieldbow/cache

$ pnpm add @shieldbow/cache
```

---

This package is part of the shieldbow library.

The shieldbow library allows you to easily interact with various aspects of the RIOT Games API
to develop third-party apps and services for League of Legends (LoL) and Teamfight Tactics (TFT).

This package provides a base cache set-up and a basic in-memory cache implementation.
